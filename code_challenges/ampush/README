The story:

The company has decided to create a simple forum available to the public.
Specific implementation details are left up to you.  The company will want
to reuse this code and possibly grow this site so!!!!

1. OOP principles will be watched.
2. You MAY NOT use a framework or other pre-built model system. (Ruby on Rails,
CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Orbit, etc)
3. This is a backend position, only basic html for the content.  No need for
ajax, jquery, etc.
4. You will not be dinged if you do not finish the project.

Everyone will have a username and a password.  There will only be one forum.

Here are the 2 tables that you must use.  Session handling can use the file
system, no need for memcache etc, cookies are also fine.

CREATE TABLE users (
    username varchar(255),
    password varchar(255),
    primary key(username)
);

CREATE TABLE board (
    username varchar(255),
    entered_on datetime,
    message text
);

Notes:
    1. Everyone has to create an account
    2. Sign up for an account
    3. Everyone has cookies enabled and you are welcome to use php sessions
    4. This is open to the public
    5. Previous messages may not be editted
    6. No replies

Steps:
1. Sign in or create an account
2. Add a message / view the board

Example screen for step 2
