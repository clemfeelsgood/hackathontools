These files were prepared for the Chegg Programming Challenge.

This set of files should have been distributed in one package. They are:

- 01_last_100_search.php (command-line)
- 03_basic_web_app_mvc.php (browser)
- 04_amazon_product_extract_data.php (command-line)
- 05_mysql_employee_salary.txt (text)
- BasePageTemplate.class.php (an include for #3)
- common.php (an include for #1)
- largefile.txt (test file for #1)
- README (this file)

1. To run, drop this into a web-directory (like ~user/public_html) and go to the URL in a web browser.
2. Otherwise, the program is meant to be run from command-line. Type "php filename" to see the usage and required arguments
