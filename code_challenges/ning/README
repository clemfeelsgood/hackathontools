Ning Challenge Question

Please create a web page for us that has one form on it. That form will have one
textarea named 'comment' and a table that will show the current comments. It
will also have a 'Submit' button that needs to use AJAX to POST the comment to
the server. The server will respond with the updated list of comments in XML. An
example of this data is available at http://codequiz.ning.com/comments.xml. The
AJAX code on the page should read the returned XML and add each comment to the
comments table. It should format dates to the local time and remove any
Javascript pseudo URLs for safety reasons.

The code you send back to us should be a combination of HTML and
Javascript. Server side code is not required. You can use any JS framework you
like (or none at all).

Files:

* README - This README file
* addComment.php - Dummy file that just returns comments.xml body
* ajax.js - My own Ajax stubs
* comments.html - The main file
* comments.js - The JavaScript used by comments.html
* comments.xml - Original comments file from http://codequiz.ning.com/comments.xml
* comments2.xml - Comments wrapped in CDATA, without it is malformed
* saXMLUtils.js - XML to JSON library From terracoder.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of Solution:

I had to modify the original comments.xml because it is malformed and cannot be
converted to JSON properly; it would try to convert the text to additional tags.

Usually, one would expect comment text to be enclosed in CDATA.

No server side code is written to actually update comments.xml because it is
assumed that the comments.xml file is generated from a SQL table instead.
